   Question to Consider : 
</h4>
    <p>
What is my goal in tithing God?

</p>
<h4 class="question">Response to Consider:
</h4>
<p>
I am tithing with the goal to: 
</p>
<p>
  Grow in my Christian faith. That I will experience more of the integrity of God in my life, that I will trust God more, that I will love God more, and that I will live more holy to God.

</p>


<h4 class="question">Question:</h4>
<p>Why is this the goal of my tithing?

</p>

<h4 class="question">Insightful Commentary
</h4>By Samuel Kirk Mills
<p>
Before his tithing in Genesis 14, Genesis 11, 12, and 13 clearly showed that Abraham was wealthy, but  relatively poorer in his spiritual and personal relations with God. There are 3 key behaviors of Abraham that indicated that before his tithing he was relatively poorer in his personal relations with God when he was initially brought to the Land of Canaan: </p>
<ol>
<li>
   Building altars when God appears to him
</li>
<li>
  Compromising on Sarah when he faced the threat of losing her and his life
</li>
<li>
  Going to the battle against the kings without consulting God. These behaviors pointed out 3 things in Abraham: 
  <ul>
    <li>Abraham’s impersonal relations with God </li>
    <li>Abraham’s weakness concerning his trust in God</li>
    <li>Abraham’s lack in his dependency on God. 
Following his tithing, Abraham was still wealthy, but became richer in his spiritual and personal relations with God. Abraham matured greatly in his personal relations with God marked by the increasing integrity of God’s personal presence in his life, his trust, love and holiness to God. 
</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

</ol>

<h4 class="question">The Basis of the Goal of Tithing
</h4>
<p>
  Abraham’s exponential growth in his personal relations with the Lord following his tithing is what gives us the goal of Church tithing as a point of grace for growth in our trusting, and loving relations with God. 

</p>

<h4 class="question">A Moment of Reflection

</h4>
<p>
  Take a few moment to ponder and/or meditate on the responses, the commentary, and the basis for the aim of Church tithing. Internalize and let them settle in your spirit/heart, and mind.
